// MsgRing will send and receive Msg instances to and from ring nodes. See
// TCPMsgRing for a concrete implementation.
//
// The design is such that messages are not guaranteed delivery, or even
// transmission. Acknowledgement and retry logic is left outside to the
// producers and consumers of the messages themselves.
//
// For example, if a connection to a node is too slow to keep up with the
// messages wanting to be delivered to it, many of the messages will simply be
// dropped.
//
// For another example, if a message is ready to be delivered to a node that
// currently has no established connection, the connection process will be
// initiated (for future messages) but that current message will be dropped.
//
// This design is because much ring-related messaging is based on passes over
// the entire ring with many messages being sent constantly and conditions can
// change rapidly, making messages less useful as they age. It is better for
// the distributed system overall if a single message is just dropped if it
// can't be sent immediately as a similar message will be generated and
// attempted later on in the next pass.
//
// For messages that require guaranteed delivery, the sender's node ID can be
// embedded in the message and receiver would send an acknowledgement message
// back upon receipt. The exact retry logic could vary greatly and depends on
// the sender's implementation (e.g. background passes recording acks or
// dedicated goroutines for each message).
//
// In previous systems we've written, distributed algorithms could easily get
// hung up trying to communicate to one faulty node (for example) making the
// rest of the system suffer as well.
